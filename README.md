# black-oak-store
To run this application, open your hyper terminal and cd over to the file location where you have downloaded the files (Eg: cd black-oak). then run this command: "npm install", this command will download all the node dependencies used in this application. After completing this step enter this command "node app.js" , this command will execute the application. app.js is the server file, where all the backend data is processed and executed. After that a msg will display on your terminal saying "server started". Now you can open the application on your localhost. The port used is 3000. locallink: http://localhost:3000/

Important: 
I am using mongodb for database. I have connected to my mongodb atlas account for data updation and deletion. If you want to add your mongodb authentication, change the url in app.js. For local the url should be "mongodb://localhost:27017/(database name)" , put this code instead of "process. env...." The database should work locally after putting this line of code. To run your mongodb server open a new terminal window and type "mongod", this should start your mongodb server.
